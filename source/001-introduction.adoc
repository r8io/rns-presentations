Part 1 -- Introduction
----
                      Release 0.4.9 Beta
----

== Open Source Software
* Do not trust ... verify


== But keep in mind
“Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.” +
_Arthur C. Clarke_


== About This Talk
* *Audience* -- People who like to communicate freely
* *Problem* -- The internet is fundamentally broken
* *Solution* -- The Reticulum Network Stack


== Goal
* *Replace the Internet Protocol Stack*
* Because it is ...
** *Not private* -- Personal source addresses
** *Censurable* -- Centralized infrastructure
** *Killable* -- Centralized infrastructure


== Reticulum Network Stack
* *Private*
** Initiator anonymity
** End-to-End Encrypted by default
* *Not Censurable*
** No centralized infrastructure needed
** No DNS and TLS certificate authorities
* *Not Killable*
** Works even with packet radio

=== Initiator anonymity
* No personally identifiable source address
** Only a 16 byte hashed address (destination) +
<13425ec15b621c1d928589718000d814>
* A transport node only knows the next hop
** Not the complete path to a destination


////
=== End-to-End Encrypted
* Destinations announce themselves to the network
* The announce contains its address and public key
* Messages are encrypted with this public key
* A new ephemeral key is used for every packet sent
* A receipt proof can be sent back to the sender
** Calculate a SHA-256 hash of the received packet
** Sign this hash with its Ed25519 signing key
* A proof is verified against the recipient's public key
////


== Mark Qvist
* Lead developer
* 2014 - 2016 -- Protocol design
* 2017 - 2022 -- Reference implementation
* Financed through own funds and donations


== Beta Status
* Reticulum is in *beta* status
* All core protocol features are implemented
* The API and wire-format are relatively stable
* Supports Android, Linux, macOS
* There will be *bugs*


////
== Programming Languages
* *Python* -- Reference implementation
** Easy to understand for code review
* *C, C++* -- RNode Firmware (rewrite)
** Fast on microprocessors
* *C* -- OpenModem
** Fast on microprocessors
////


== A Message Oriented System
* High-latency, low-bandwidth links
* Point-to-point communication
* Point-to-multipoint communication
* Direct communication with clients in range
* Communication over multiple hops in a network

=== Hardware
* *RNode* -- LoRa radio transceiver
* *OpenModem* -- Packet radio modem and TNC


== Terminology
* *Reticulum* -- Network Stack
* *LXMF* -- Messaging format and delivery protocol
* *Nomad Network* -- Mesh communication platform
* *Peer* -- LXMF client
* *Node* -- Nomade Network instance
** Can propagate and store messages
** Can host pages and files


== What Does It Do?
* *Right Now*
** Peer-to-Peer text chat
** Encrypted QR paper messages
** Host pages, files and message boards
* *Future Plan*
** Group chat
** Chat with image and audio messages
** Talk with half-duplex audio


== Features
* Transport agnostic
* Peer-to-Peer to Planetary-Scale
* Self-configuring multi-hop routing
* Unforgeable packet delivery confirmation
* Cryptography-based network stack
* End-to-End Encryption
* Forward Secrecy
* Initiator Anonymity


== Applications
* Build wide-area networks with off-the-shelf tools
** LoRa, packet radio, WiFi, Ethernet
* Operate under adverse conditions
** Extremely low bandwidth
** Very high latency
* Use carrier pigeons
** Encrypted QR paper messages


== Runs Almost Everywhere
* LoRa radios, data radios, modems
* Serial lines, AX.25 TNCs
* Amateur radio digital modes
* Wifi, Ethernet devices
* Fibre-optic transceivers
* TCP or UDP over IP networks
* I2P network
* Encrypted QR Paper Messages


== Extremely Efficient
* Supports a half-duplex channels with +
500 bit/s and MTU of 500 byte

* What's needed to start a secure connection
** TLS1.3 Connection -- 15 packets, 10.000 bytes
** RNS Link -- 3 packets, 297 bytes

////
* Only 0.45 bit/s needed to keep a RNS Link open
** 100 concurrent links on a 1200 bit/s packet radio channel will leave 96% capacity for actual data
////


=== Maximum Transmission Unit
* Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU)
* Specifies the maximum size of a data packet
* Measured in bytes


[%notitle]
== Goodby Internet Stack
image::stack-layer-model.svg[Static, size=100%]


== Not An Overlay-Network
* *Tor and I2P*
** Run on top of TCP (Tor) or IP (I2P)
** Try to solve TCP/IP legacy problems
* *Reticulum*
** A completely new network stack
** Can replace Ethernet, IP, TCP, TLS and HTTP
** No legacy problems


== Destinations
* No addresses and ports known from IP, TCP, UDP
* Reticulum uses 128 bit (16 byte) *destination* hashes
* Displayed to the user as 16 hexadecimal bytes
** <13425ec15b621c1d928589718000d814>
* Can be named in a dotted notation
** logger.sensor.temperature
