# RNS Presentations

I am in the process of learning about the [Reticulum Network Stack (RNS)](https://github.com/markqvist/reticulum)

What better idea is there, than to produce presentations about a subject you are not familiar with :-) Please feel free to like, dislike or discuss.

To view the presentations, please visit [RNS Presentations](https://r8io.github.io/rns-presentations)
